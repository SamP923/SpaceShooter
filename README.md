# SpaceShooter
A 2D game where the player defends themselves from incoming enemy spaceships. Made with Unity for Game Design 2019.

## Controls
WASD to move, space to fire.

## Gameplay
The player is the spaceship that starts at the bottom of the screen. They are able to fire red lasers to destroy the incoming enemy spaceships, adding 1 to the user's score. The spaceships are endless, meaning the game ends when the player loses all three lives. When the player loses a life, the tracker in the top left corner will remove a life, and the player's spaceship sprite will change to show an engine burning. There are three power-ups for the player to collect throughout the game.
   - Speed: Increases the player speed by 100%
   - Shield: Gives the player protection from collision with one enemy.
   - Triple Shot: Allows the player to shoot three lasers at once.
